# Social Network API

## Description

I have built a back end application which creates a social network api. This application allows you to create users which can add and delete friends. It also allows you to create thoughts which users can react to. This application uses node and mongo db.

## Installation

In order to run this application you will need to have installed VS Code, cloned down the repo, used node (npm i) to install all dependencies and have access to Insomnia to test the application. You will also need to run node server.js to start the application.

## Usage

This is a back end application therefore you will need to use Insomnia to test the api requests and end points. I have provided a video demonstration to show you how to use this application which can be found in demo.

## Tests

You will test the application using Insomnia. You will need to ensure you are using the correct end points and JSON bodies in order for the requests to be successful. You can test if any of these fail by testing the endpoints and seeing if you get a 404 and an error message. You can also put invalid ID's in and you will receieve a 404 error and message.
